Red9_Audio
==========

Red9 Audio is the module for all audio handling within the Red9 pack.
 
This includes the wrapper to the new audio compile tools for mixing multiple wavs 
inside Maya to a single merged track, allowing you to finally playblast multiple 
separate audio nodes! Why the hell Autodesk haven't done this I have no idea
as it's a major issue when you're dealing with facial sequences. There's is 
a 'compile' flag in the playblast command but it's never worked.
