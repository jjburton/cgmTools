Red9_CoreUtils
==============

Red9_CoreUtils is the backbone of much of the systems, used to filter, find and process nodes
on mass withing Maya as well as containing a lot of core functions for dealing with data.

The FilterNode and FilterSettings classes are used throughout the pack, in fact any
time the tools process a hierarchy it's these classes that deal with it.
