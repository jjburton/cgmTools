Firstly thanks for your interest, if you'd like to get more involved mail me!

This Maya Python module is an ongoing project to bring extensive support for those 
studios without the luxury of their own R&D department. Maya out of the box is 
sadly lacking in a lot of the love that large studios show it through their own 
toolsets, this StudioPack is aimed at correcting that balance.

For suggestions and info please feel free to contact me.

Install instructions in the installer folder, there's also full api docs ;)
