Pro_Pack : animation
=====================

ProPack animation module deals with the more complex animation functions
such as the animation re-director systems. Recently the r9Anim codebase
was shifted over to it's own module during maintenance for clarity

	>>> # import statement for the module via the r9pro decompiler
	>>> from Red9.pro_pack import r9pro 
	>>> r9panim = r9pro.r9import('r9panim')
	
.. automodule:: Red9.pro_pack.core.animation
   
   .. rubric:: Main Classes

   .. autosummary::
   	  
      Anim_Redirect
      AnimPointCloud
      Anim_Transfer
	  Pro_To_Bnd_UI
