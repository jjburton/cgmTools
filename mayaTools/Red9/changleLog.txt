Red9 Studio Pack ChangeLog:
===========================

v1.29:
------
New - Red9_Anim - PoseLib now supports subfolders in the UI
New - Red9_Anim - CameraTracker now in the Red9 Menu - generates an auto tracked, or panned, camera focusing on the selected node - very usefuyl for visualizing moCap
New - Red9_Meta - metaHUDNode added - designed as a debug tool to enable you to easily monitor attributes in a managed HUD in the Maya viewports. Any attrs added to the mNode is monitored and added to the drawHud call. This is work in progress
Mod - Red9_Anim - AnimtionFunctions now has a function for bindNodes, uses the same filtering and matching setups as all the rest of the code and allows you to bind full filtered hierarchies together, either direct connects or parentConstraints
Mod - Red9_Anim - All animFunctions now accept matchMethod as an arg, this allows you to either accept 'prefix stripping' in any node matches or use 'base' = name for name exact match.
Fix - Red9_Anim - PoseLib subfolders bug fixes so that you can sync subfolders to project libraries with the 'CopyLocal>>Project Pose' RMB call. This makes the missing subFolder if it's missing in the Project structure
Mod - Red9_General - Timer decorator now shows module/class and func in the report feedback
Mod - Red9_Meta - Added **KWS update support to the addAttr call, if the attr exists and you've passed in kws then these will get synced and updated if in the internal 'valid edit kws' list. Great for use in the __bindData__ call to sync properties.
Mod - Red9_Core - Added more logic to the main MatchedNodeInputs call. Now allows you to pass in 2 hierarchies directly for processing. This means you can by-pass the filter processing in all animation Functions and pass 2 hierarchies directly in for processing!

1.291:
------
Fix - Red9_Meta - type 'unicode' value's weren't being supported correctly in the setAttr func
Fix - Red9_Anim - MirrorSetup - loadMirror was failing to load custom Axis correctly.

1.292:
------
Fix - Red9_Meta - isChildNode() wasn't dealing with longNames correctly
Mod - Red9_PoseSaver - batchPatchPoses() modified to make it more flexible. added arg to stop it always resaving the pose after patchfunc has been run. also now passing poseFile back into patchfunc
New - Red9_PoseSaver - poseHandler.py support added! - This is a BIG deal for TD's out there as it gives you access to all the internal node handling at a sub-folder level. Allows you to fully customize the pose behaviour on a folder basis!
Fix - Red9_Anim - PoseUI wasn't remembering the last subFolderyou were in.

1.293:
------
New - Red9_Anim - PoseUI now has a RMB Make Directory call
New - Red9_Anim - PoseUI now has a 'Debug:Copy poseHandler.py to Folder'. This is an avanced option for by-passing the node handlers on a folder by folder basis!
Mod - Red9_Anim - 'Ctrl' click when launching the AnimationUI will boot it non-docked
Mod - Red9_Meta - Calls that previously only took an mType/mInstance as a [string] arg now also accept the class too... so r9Meta.getMetaNodes('MetaRig') and r9Meta.getMetaRig(r9Meta.MetaRig) both are accepted.
Mod - Red9_Meta - getChildren now takes an additional arg 'cAttrs' which can be used to only return children connected via a given attr name (this uses wildcards and will take a list)

1.294:
------
Fix - Red9_Anim - added full traceback to the error handling in the AnimUI
Fix - Red9_Meta - added full traceback to the error handling in the nodeLockManager and thus the main class
Fix - Red9_Meta - setAttr wasn't raising errors due to the decorator. Patched
Mod - Red9_Meta - updated MetaHUD, simplified event handler, now connected to refresh by default
New - Red9_Meta - Added HUD wrappers now being called by the ChannelBox RMB menu - gives you access to the MetaHud monitors and makes the setup more integrated
Fix - Red9_Meta - Bug fix in the getConnectedMetaNodes. This was returning connected mNodes via all attrs, not just those connected via message links. Hence if 2 mNodes were connected via tx that would have passed through, which is wrong!

1.30:
------
New - Red9_Core - added specific handling for blendShape nodetypes in the FilterNode so that in hierarchy mode, blendshpaes attached to meshes in that hierarchy will be returned also
New - Red9_PoseSaver - added support for blendShapes, now writing the data (using the updated filter above) via the aliasAttr call to extarct the blendTarget channels by name and store as such
Fix - Red9_Meta - MASSIVE BUG FIX!!! Found a way to check if the internal MObject is valid before being used (in the mNode property) This is what was crashing Maya if you had an mNode in the scene and had deleted it, or reloaded the scene etc. The pointer is now validated before being used
Mod - Red9_Meta - added isValid func, considered inValid if not linked to anything else.

1.31:
------
New - Red9_Meta - added a getMClassInstances() function which returns registered metaClass that are subclasses of the given arg. Good for grouping classes based on core base classes
Mod - Red9_setup - modified the way I hack the native menu's, pulled the main calls and menu's out into a single mel file for all Maya versions to make things easier
Fix - Red9_PoseSaver - the buildInternalDict call wasn't resetting the poseDict before running, this meant that if you were running this in a batch mode, the dict would just keep getting extended
Mod - Red9_PoseSaver - modified the poseHandler.py setup, now allows you to directly hack into the RMB popup menu in the poseUI and add your own items via the 'posePopupAdditions' func
Mod - Red9_PoseSaver - modified the posePath handler, if either the 'local' or 'project' main folders contain no poses then the UI switches straight to the subFolder handler
New - Red9_General - added 'Red9_Sound' menu and functions to the TraxEditor!
