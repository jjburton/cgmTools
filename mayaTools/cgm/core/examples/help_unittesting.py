#>>The basic premise of unit testing is is a series of assertations to make sure that things that we tried to make happen did
assert 1==1
#Nothing, 1 does indeed equal 1 so nothing happens
assert 1==2
#// Error: Encountered exception:  // 

#Okay, so it is great to know that there is something wrong but this doesn't help much if this is in a long line of code
#Instead, we can offer an exception message with it
assert 1==2,"No, 1 != 2"
