	returns a dictionary keyed by the referenced filename.  Key values are dictionaries which are
	keyed by reference node (any file can be referenced multiple times) the value of which are the
	given nodes that are referenced.

	example:
	we have a scene with three references:
	refA comes from c:/someFile.ma
	refB comes from c:/someFile.ma
	refC comes from c:/anotherFile.ma

	we have 3 nodes: nodeA, nodeB and nodeC.

	nodeA comes from refA
	nodeB comes from refB
	nodeA comes from refC

	in this example running getRefFilepathDictForNodes( ('nodeA', 'nodeB', 'nodeC') ) would return:

	{ 'c:/someFile.ma': { 'refA': [ 'nodeA' ], 'refB': [ 'nodeB' ],
