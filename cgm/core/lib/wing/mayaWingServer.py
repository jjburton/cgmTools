    The server will wait to recieve data from a single client.  When it receives
    data, it will 'process' it via the processFunc function.

    processFunc : function : A function object that will
        process the data recieved by the client.  It should accept a single
        string argument.
    port : int : Default to global PORT.  The port to connect to.
    backlog : int : Default to global BACKLOG.  The number of connections the

        the client.
