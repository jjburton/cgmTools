    Flags:
      - adjustableColumn : adj         (bool)          [create,edit]
          Sets the children of the layout to be attached on both sides. They will stretch or shrink with the layout.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]

      - columnAlign : cal              (unicode)       [create,edit]

      - columnAttach : cat             (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
          Sets the attachment and offsets for the children of the layout.  Side values: left| right| both.  Left or both is
          recommended.
    
      - columnOffset : co              (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
          Sets the offsets for children of the layout. Side values: left| right| both.
    
      - columnWidth : cw               (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the width of the column.  Unless the children are attached to both sides of the column, the width cannot be
          enforced. Larger children will expand layout.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]

          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - rowSpacing : rs                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the space between children.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

    are its immediate children. Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that
    children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the
    argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six
    ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3
    leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an
    edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge
    of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side
    of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a
    fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a
    percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will
    determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is
    no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in
    each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate
    child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of
    divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a
    measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in
    pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:Avoid making control
    attachments that form a loop in control dependencies. For example: window; string $form = `formLayout`; string $btn1 =
    `button`; string $btn2 = `button`; string $btn3 = `button`;formLayout -edit-attachControl $btn2 top2 $btn1-attachControl
    $btn3 top2 $btn2-attachControl $btn1 right2 $btn3 $form;showWindow; $btn2 is attached to $btn1, $btn3 is attached to
    $btn2, and $btn1 is attached to $btn3. Thus, the placement of $btn1 is dependent on the placement of $btn3, which is
    dependent on the placement of $btn2, which is dependent on the placement of $btn1. The last control attachment will have
    created a loop in the dependencies. To prevent runtime errors, Maya will ignore this attachment and instead issue a
    warning that a cyclical control attachment has been detected in the script.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - attachControl : ac             (unicode, unicode, int, unicode) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset, control Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to
          another control.
    
      - attachForm : af                (unicode, unicode, int) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset. Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach the specified control to
          the form, offset by the specified amount.
    
      - attachNone : an                (unicode, unicode) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to nothing.
    
      - attachOppositeControl : aoc    (unicode, unicode, int, unicode) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset, control Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to the
          opposite side of another control.
    
      - attachOppositeForm : aof       (unicode, unicode, int) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset. Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to the opposite
          side of the form.
    
      - attachPosition : ap            (unicode, unicode, int, int) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset, position Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to a
          position in the form.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

          Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
    
      - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
          Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
    
      - numberOfDivisions : nd         (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specify the number of horizontal and vertical divisions across the form. Value must be greater than 0.

          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

      - renderPriority : rp            (int)           [create,edit]
          Specifies the priority to render the swatch. This flag can only be used in parallel swatch rendering. When more than one
          swatch are waiting in the render queue, this flag can be used to specify which one has the higher priority to be
          rendered. By default, the flag is set to 0 - low priority. The larger the number, the higher priority is used to render
          the swatch. Maya pre-defined the render priority for the swatch in Node Editor, Attribute Editor and Hypershade as
          below: 0: The lowest render priority. 1: The render priority for the swatch in Node Editor. 2: The render priority for
          the swatch in the working area of HyperShade 3: The render priority for the swatch in Attribute Editor. For example,
          when creating a display port in AE using the swatchDisplayPort command, option -rp 3is used.

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    This command creates a control that displays the gradient attribute specified. The gradient attribute must be of the
    correct form and naming. It should be a multi attribute with each entry a compound composed of: Either a color compound
    or a float value (the control will automatically detect which and display a ramp or graph accordingly).A single float
    attribute for position.An enum for the interpolation types.Currently the routines to get the value of a ramp structure
    (with interpolation) are not available through MEL, which limits the use of this control by end users. The MEL command
    AEaddRampControl should be used to attach this control to an attribute from attribute editor templates.
    
    Flags:
      - adaptiveScaling : adaptiveScaling (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to

          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - clear : clr                    (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clears the field.

          Cuts the current selection from this field.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

def iconTextButton(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best
    fits the current size of the control given its current style. This command creates an iconTextButton that can be
    displayed with different icons, with or without accompanying text label. When an argument is passed, it is used to give
    a name to the iconTextButton.
    
    Flags:

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - command : c                    (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control is pressed.
    
      - commandRepeatable : rpt        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Set if the MEL command specified in the command flag should be repeatable or not.  The gkey, by default, is the shortcut
          to repeat the last executed command.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
          a Windows only flag.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control is double clicked.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

def hudButton(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) button control which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D
    viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD button is derived from a
    generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow. Although this command provides much of the same functionality
    as the headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls such as layoutVisibility,
    nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove, etc. To access that functionality, please use the headsUpDisplay
    command. This command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD button controls. Similarly, all
    operations performed by this command are limited to HUDs that are button controls. The only mandatory flags, on creation
    are the section and block flags. Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD button, an ID number will be
    assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD via the headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if
    desired. Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via their position (section and block), or
    their unique name.
    
    Flags:
      - allowOverlap : ao              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag
          description for more details).
    
      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. For HUD buttons, the format differs from
          that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify,
          padding, buttonWidth) is shown below: __________________________________ |     |     |          |     |     | |  P  |  J
          |  Button  |  J  |  P  | |_____|_____|__________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the
          entire block Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge
          of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from
          visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly,
          there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in
          an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
    
      - blockAlignment : ba            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: center, leftand right. The
          default alignment is left.
    
      - blockSize : bs                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds
          to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.
    
      - buttonShape : bsh              (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the shape of the button. Available button shapes are: rectangleand roundRectangle. The first will draw a

      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.
          ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |
          |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

def layout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command allows you to edit or query the properties of any layout. The argument is the name of the layout.
    In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          The initial dock area for this dock control. Valid values are top, left, bottomand right. This is a required flag.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - content : con                  (unicode)       [create,query]

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

def hudSlider(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) slider control which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D
    viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD slider is derived from a
    generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow. Although this command provides much of the same functionality
    as the headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls such as layoutVisibility,
    nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove, etc. To access that functionality, please use the headsUpDisplay
    command. This command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD sliders. Similarly, all operations
    performed by this command are limited to HUDs that are sliders. The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section
    and block flags. Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD slider, an ID number will be assigned to it.
    This can be used to remove the HUD slider via the headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired.
    Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via their position (section and block), or their unique
    name.
    
    Flags:
      - allowOverlap : ao              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag

      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. For HUD sliders, the format differs from
          that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify,
          padding, labelWidth, valueWidth) is shown below: __________________________________________________________________ |

          J  |  P  | |_____|_____|________|____________|______|_____________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J =
          Justification of the entire block LW = Sub-block of width, labelWidth Slider = Length of the slider SliderValue = Sub-
          block of width, valueWidth IP = Internal padding Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge of
          the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility
          from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can
          be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error.
          Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
    
      - blockAlignment : ba            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: center, leftand right. The

      - blockSize : bs                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds
          to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.
    
      - decimalPrecision : dp          (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are

      - internalPadding : ip           (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the amount of padding between the internal elements of the HUD. For the hudSlider, this represents the padding
          between the slider bar and the slider value. The default padding is 10.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Text label of the HUD.

          justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the textbox,the label will be truncated to fit within
          the dimensions of the textbox.(To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
    
      - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the maximum value of the slider. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is
          int, the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
    
      - minValue : min                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the minimum value of the slider. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is

      - padding : p                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
    
      - pressCommand : pc              (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse click event.
    
      - releaseCommand : rc            (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse release event.
    
      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.
          ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |

          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
    
      - sliderIncrement : si           (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the number of increments along the slider. If not specified or set to 0 or less, the slider will be linearly
          even and continuous from minValue to maxValue. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type
          is int, the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
    
      - sliderLength : sl              (int)           [create,query,edit]

    there is no command attached to the menu. In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:
      - addCommand : ac                (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the node outliner adds something. String commands use substitution of the term %node for whatever
          is added, eg, if you want to print the object added, the command should be print(\%node \\n\.  Callable python objects
          are passed the node name.
    
      - addObject : a                  (PyNode)        [edit]
          add the given object to the display
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - attrAlphaOrder : aao           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specify how attributes are to be sorted.  Current recognised values are defaultfor no sorting and ascendto sort
          attributes from 'a' to ''z' and descendto sort from 'z' to 'a'. Notes: a) this only applies to top level attributes.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - connectivity : c               (PyNode)        [query,edit]
          Takes an attribute argument (nodeName.attributeName), dims any attributes that can't connect to the given, and
          highlights any attributes already connected
    
      - currentSelection : cs          (bool)          [query]
          Retruns a string array containing what is currently selected
    
      - dc : dc                        (callable)      []
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
          longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
          longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

          Sets the default location for the given context. The two optional arguments (Python only) are the category (tab) and
          location. To clear the content use empty strings for category and location.
    
      - control : ctl                  (bool)          [query]
          Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.

          Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
          will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
          deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
          user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - hsvValue : hsv                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          Three float values corresponding to the hue, saturation, and value color components, where the hue value ranges from 0.0
          to 360.0 and the saturation and value components range from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable integer
    fields. The label text is optional and one to four fields can be created.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

          tab layouttop- Only draw a simple line right below the tabsnotop- Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top)
          of the tab layoutfull- Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-
          selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - childResizable : cr            (bool)          [create,query]
          Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a
          minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidthflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when a tab is double clicked on.  Note that the first click will select the tab and the second click
          will execute the double click command.  Double clicking the current tab will re-invoke the double click command.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - minChildWidth : mcw            (int)           [create,query]
          Specify a positive non-zero integer value indicating the minimum width the tab layout's children.  This flag only has
          meaning when the -cr/childResizableflag is set to true.

          Command executed when the 'New Tab' button (on the tab bar) is clicked.  Note: in order to show the new tab button use
          the -snt/showNewTabflag.  Using this command will override any internal Maya logic for adding a new tab (only this
          command will be executed).
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

          Command executed when a tab is selected but before it's contents become visible.  Re-selecting the current tab will not
          invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTabor
          -sti/selectTabIndexflags.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          children are returned.
    
      - tabLabelIndex : tli            (int, unicode)  [create,query,edit]
          Identical to the -tl/tabLabelflag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the label
          for. If this flag is queried the tab labels for all the children are returned.
    
      - tabsClosable : tc              (bool)          [create,query]

      - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
          that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

      - polarity : pol                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the polarity of the slider. If 0 (the default), the minimum value (specified by the -minimum flag) occurs at
          the bottom end of the slider and maximum at the top(right), with values increasing as the slider handles are moved
          towards the upper end of the slider. If the polarity is specified as 1, the reverse behaviour occurs, with the maximum
          occurring at the bottom end, the mimimum occuring at the top(right) end and values decreasing as the handles are moved
          towards the upper end.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]

          Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 1 of this slider. The control must be a floatField.
          The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
    
      - positionControl2 : pc2         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 2 of this slider. The control must be a floatField.
          The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

          Value of handle 1. To ensure that handle 1 stays at or below handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too
          large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
    
      - value2 : v2                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Value of handle 2. To ensure that handle 2 stays at or above handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too
          large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
    
      - values : vs                    (float, float)  [create,edit]
          Sets the value for handles 1 and 2 simulteneously. The first argument is applied to handle 1 and must be less than or
          equal to the second (handle 2) argument or an error will be issued.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

def editorTemplate(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The editorTemplate command allows the user to specify the conceptual layout of an attribute editor and leave the details
    of exactly which UI elements are used in the final result to the automatic dialog generation mechanism.
    
    Flags:
      - addAdskAssetControls : aac     (bool)          [create]
          Adds controls for dynamic attributes of adskMaterial nodes and organizes them in a layout according to the XML ui
          description specified in the asset library.
    
      - addComponents : acp            (bool)          [create]
          This flag will add a frameLayout with a channel box which will display any selected components for the object.
    
      - addControl : ac                (bool)          [create]
          The first argument is the name of the attribute for which you wish to add a control. You can assume that when the editor
          is created from the template, an appropriate type of control will be used. The second string argument is optional, and
          can be used to specify a command (or script) to be executed when the attribute is changed.
    
      - addDynamicControl : adc        (bool)          [create]
          As -addControl with the exception that the attribute for which the control is to be created/attached is dynamic. [Note:
          -addControl will also work for dynamic attributes, but will not preserve their order in the attribute editor].
    
      - addExtraControls : aec         (bool)          [create]
          By default, if there are attributes of a node which you do not -addControl or -suppress, then controls will be created
          automatically and appended to the end of editor created from the template. This flag allows you to specify a particular
          place in the template for such controls to be automatically inserted. If dynamic attributes have not already been
          addressed with -addControl, they will also be placed here.  A frameLayout will automatically be generated for you when
          you use this flag.
    
      - addSeparator : addSeparator    (bool)          [create]
          Adds a separator to the template.
    
      - annotateFieldOnly : afo        (bool)          [create]
          This flag can only be used with the -annotation flag.  By default, for any Attribute Editor controlGroups created by the
          -addControl flag, the -annotation flag displays its annotation string when the mouse hovers over any control that is
          part (the label, the value field, etc.) of the group.  Use this flag to limit display of the annotation to only the
          value field of the controlGroup.  This flag is ignored if the controlGroup has no value field (e.g., checkBoxGrp)
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create]
          This flag can only be used with the -addControl or the -addDynamicControl flags. The string will be used as an
          annotation on the controls created in the attribute editor.
    
      - beginLayout : bl               (unicode)       [create]
          Begins a layout in the template with the title specified by the string argument. Items between this flag and    its
          corresponding -endLayout flag will be contained within the layout. You can assume that when the editor is created from
          the template, an appropriate type of layout will be used. (frameLayout).
    
      - beginNoOptimize : bn           (bool)          [create]
          Specifies that the layout of items between this flag and its corresponding -endNoOptimize flag is not to be optimized to
          minimize space.
    
      - beginScrollLayout : bsl        (bool)          [create]
          Begins a scrollLayout.  Items between this flag and its corresponding -endScrollLayout flag will be contained within the
          layout.
    
      - callCustom : ccu               (bool)          [create]
          Specifies that at this point in the template when building the dialog, the procedure specified by the first argument is
          to be called to create some UI objects when a new node type is edited. The procedure specified by the second argument is
          to be called if an attribute editor already exists and another node of the same type is now to be edited. The replacing
          procedure should connect any controls created by the creating procedure to the equivalent attributes in the new node. A
          list of zero or more attributes specifies the attributes which the two procedures will involve. The procedures should
          have the signature: proc AEcustomNew(string attributeName1, string attributeName2) The number of attributes specified in
          the call should correspond to the number of attributes in the procedure signature.
    
      - collapse : cl                  (bool)          [create]
          This flag is only valid when used in conjunction with a -bl/beginLayout flag.  It is used to specify the initial
          expand/collapse state of the layout.  A true value will cause the layout to be collapsed upon creation, while a false
          value will expand the layout.  The default is true (ie. collapsed).
    
      - debugMode : dbm                (bool)          []
    
      - dimControl : dc                (unicode, unicode, bool) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to affect.  The third argument is a boolean which
          specifies whether to dim (true) or undim (false) the associated control.
    
      - endLayout : el                 (bool)          [create]
          Ends a layout in the template started by -beginLayout.
    
      - endNoOptimize : en             (bool)          [create]
          Ends a set of non-optimized items.
    
      - endScrollLayout : esl          (bool)          [create]
          Ends a scrollLayout.
    
      - extraControlsLabel : ecl       (unicode)       [create]
          By default the label is Extra Attributes. Specify an alternate label or an empty string to hide the label. This flag
          must be used in conjuction with the -aec/addExtraControls flag.
    
      - interruptOptimize : io         (bool)          [create]
          Enforces a division between two sets of items whose layouts may be optimized.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create]
          This flag can only be used with the -addControl or the -addDynamicControl flags.  And it must be specified FIRST. The
          string will override the name of the attribute that will be displayed in the attribute editor.
    
      - listExtraAttributes : lea      (unicode)       [create]
          List extra attributes.This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).
          The first argument is the node name.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - queryControl : qc              (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to query.  Note that in most cases, using this flag
          is identical to issuing a getAttr command, however, in the case of textFields (e.g. for message attributes), the text
          value currently being displayed will be returned, NOT the actual attribute value.
    
      - queryLabel : ql                (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control label you wish to query.  In most cases this flag returns
          the same value as the attribute's nice name, but when a -label flag was present on the -addControl command that created
          the control, -queryLabel will return that value instead
    
      - queryName : qn                 (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control name you wish to query.
    
      - removeControl : rc             (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is obsolete and should no longer be used.
    
      - suppress : s                   (unicode)       [create]
          Prevent a control for the attribute specified by the string argument from appearing in the editor created from the
          template.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editLabelCommand : elc         (script)        [create,edit]
          Set the callback function to be invoked when the user changes the name of an item by double clicking it in the UI. The
          callback should accept two string arguments: the item name and the new name. The item name refers to the name of the
          item and not the display label. The callback function should return a string. An empty string indicates that the rename
          operation was invalid and the control should revert to the original name. If the rename operation is valid the callback
          should return a string that identifies the item, possibly different from the new display name entered by the user.

      - selectCommand : sc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Set the callback function to be invoked when an item is selected or deselected in the tree. The function should accept
          one string argument and one integer argument: the item name and the select state respectively. If the function returns
          true, the select/deselect is considered valid and will occur normally, otherwise it will be disallowed. name and
    
      - selectItem : si                (unicode, bool) [create,query,edit]
          Sets an item's selected state. first argument specifies the item, second argument specifies selection status. When used

      - selectionChangedCommand : scc  (script)        [create,edit]
          Set the callback function to be invoked when a complete selection operation triggered by the user has occurred
          successfully. The callback is invoked if the selectCommandcallback has returned a non-empty value (or always there is no
          selectCommandcallback). This differs from selectCommand in that a simple selection replacement will generate two
          callbacks with selectCommand(one for deselect of the old item and one for select of the new), whereas
          selectionChangedCommandwill only be invoked once, after the selection is complete. The callback is not passed any
          parameters and does not need to return any value (i.e. It is simply a notification mechanism).
    
      - selectionColor : scl           (unicode, float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          Sets the color an item will turn to indicate that it is selected. first parameter specifies the item three float values
          specify RGB values, between 0 and 1. When used for query, this flag has no argument and needs to be used with the flag
          item. It returns the color an item will become if it is selected.
    
      - showItem : shi                 (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Show the  item. Scroll the list as necessary so that item is visible.
    
      - textColor : tc                 (unicode, float, float, float) [create,edit]
          Sets the label's text color for the specified layer. first argument specifies layer. three float values specify RGB
          values, between 0 and 1.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

def defaultNavigation(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The defaultNavigation command defines default behaviours when creating or manipulating connections between nodes and
    when navigating between nodes via those connections. This command is primarily used by attribute editors.
    
    Flags:
      - connectToExisting : ce         (bool)          [create]
          Connect the destination (which is a node.attribute or simply node) to an existing source. If the source is specified (as
          node.attribute or simply as node), the command will proceed immediately. If the source is not specified, the user will
          be prompted to specify one. Once a source has been specified, a best guess will be made about what the user is trying to
          accomplish by connecting the two, based on the type of source and type of destination. The command will connect the
          nodes/attributes according to the best guess. The destination is specified using the destinationflag and the source
          specified using the sourceflag.
    
      - createNew : cn                 (bool)          [create]
          Create a new node and connect it to the node.attribute specified using the destinationflag.
    
      - defaultAttribute : da          (bool)          [create]
          Returns the name of the attribute to which a connectNodeToNode would connect, given the source(attribute) and
          destination(node) flags. Returns a string.
    
      - defaultTraversal : dtv         (bool)          [create]
          Returns the name of the node to which it would make the most sense to navigate to from the destination node.attribute
          specified. The destination is specified using the destinationflag. Returns a string.
    
      - defaultWorkingNode : dwn       (bool)          [create]
          Returns the name of the node which the user is most likely to want to work with if they are interested in the attributes
          of the destination node. The destination is specified using the destinationflag. Returns a string.
    
      - delete : delete                (bool)          [create]
          Delete nodes with connections flowing into the node.attribute specified by the destinationflag.
    
      - destination : d                (PyNode)        [create]
          Specifies an existing destination attribute for a createNew or connectToExisting.

      - force : f                      (bool)          [create]
          If set to true, then an attempt to connect a source attribute to a destination attribute which already has a source will
          cause the existing source to be disconnected and the new source to be connected in its place. Default value is true.
    
      - ignore : i                     (bool)          [create]
          Ignore any connections flowing into the node.attribute specified by the destinationflag.
    
      - navigatorDecisionString : nds  (unicode)       [create]
          This is your opportunity to pass the navigator a string that can help it decide what behaviour to execute.
    
      - quiet : qt                     (bool)          [create]
          If set to true, then under no circumstances should the user be prompted for more information. Default value is false.
    
      - relatedNodes : ren             (bool)          [create]
          List nodes which are conceptually related to the node.attribute specified by the destination. Related nodes may include,

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          affect the dependency graph. Query returns int.
    
      - greasePencilSequenceNames : gn (bool)          [query]
          Returns the names of all grease pencil sequences that have frames being displayed in the time line.  Query returns

      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the time slider will use as its source of content.  The time
          slider will only display keys for items contained in the selectionConnection object.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

def hudSliderButton(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) slider button control which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on
    the 3D viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD slider button
    control is derived from a generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow. Although this command provides much
    of the same functionality as the headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls such as
    layoutVisibility, nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove, etc. To access that functionality, please use the
    headsUpDisplay command. This command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD slider button controls.
    Similarly, all operations performed by this command are limited to HUDs that are slider button controls. The only
    mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block flags. Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD
    slider button, an ID number will be assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD slider via the headsUpDisplay
    command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired. Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via
    their position (section and block), or their unique name.
    
    Flags:
      - allowOverlap : ao              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag

      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. For HUD sliders, the format differs from
          that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify,
          padding, labelWidth, valueWidth) is shown below:
          __________________________________________________________________________ |     |     |      |           |      |

          block of width, valueWidth Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth IP = Internal Padding Block PositioningBlocks on the
          top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks
          are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not
          draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an
          occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
    
      - blockAlignment : ba            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: center, leftand right. The

      - decimalPrecision : dp          (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are
          1 to 8.
    
      - internalPadding : ip           (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the amount of padding between the internal elements of the HUD. For the hudSlider, this represents the padding
          between the slider bar and the slider value. The default padding is 10.
    
      - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the maximum value of the slider. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is
          int, the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
    
      - minValue : min                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the minimum value of the slider. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is
          int, the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
    
      - padding : p                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
    
      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.
          ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |
          |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
    
      - sliderDragCommand : sdc        (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the procedure or script to run during a slider mouse drag event.
    
      - sliderIncrement : si           (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Specify the number of increments along the slider. If not specified or set to 0 or less, the slider will be linearly
          even and continuous from minValue to maxValue. Note:Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type
          is int, the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items to be edited. Menu items are represented
    by labelled icons which can be dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout.  Various objects can be
    dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items: toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons
    from the shelf, iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window. When editing a Marking
    Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons arranged in a circle within the menuEditor.  Overflow items in the
    Marking Menu (or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial items. To edit a submenu of a
    popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created (typically within its own window) and attached to its parent
    menuEditor. Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument.  For these, positions are
    specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string corresponds to a radial position (possibily None) and the int
    corresponds to a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none).  Radial positions are specified by one of (N,0),
    (NE,0), (E,0), (SE,0), (S,0), (SW,0), (W,0) or (NW,0).  Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with (None,i),
    where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within the overflow column.Note:This command is not meant to

          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a check box. If queried, an array of
          booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - command : c                    (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The command or script executed by a menu item. The arguments are the command string or script name, followed by the
          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item or a separator item. If queried, an
          array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items
          (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - delete : d                     (unicode, int)  [edit]
          Deletes the menu item at the given position, removing it from the menu.  If the menu item has a submenu, and a sub-
          menuEditor is open and attached to it, then the sub-menuEditor's window and all its child menuEditor windows will be
          closed recursively.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - iconMenuCallback : imc         (unicode)       [create]
          This is the name of a MEL callback procedure that is called to create the popup menus attached to icons in the
          menuEditor.  The callback is called once for each newly created icon, and once each time an icon is moved within the
          menuEditor.  Popup menus created by the callback should contain commands for editing the menu item associated with the
          icon.  Operations accessible through the menu should include deletion of the item, editing of the item's
          label/command/image/checkbox/optionbox, creation of a submenu, and popping up a sub-menuEditor. The arguments to the
          callback must match this form: callbackProc(string $menuEditorName, string $parentIconName, string $menuTitle, string
          $radialPosition, int $overflowRow); The popup menu's parent should be $parentIconName. Note that when a sub-menuEditor
          is created, this flag need not be re-specified as it adopts a default value equal to the value of its parent
          menuEditor's -imc/iconMenuCallback flag.
    
      - image : i                      (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]

          item. The arguments are the icon filename, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is
          returned containing all the icon filenames. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]

          corresponding string is returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW),
          and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

    Flags:
      - allowEmptyCells : aec          (bool)          [create,query]
          Specify true if you want free positioning of the children in the layout and potentially leaving empty cells between
          children. Set to false if you want the children to always be packed together. The default is true.

      - autoGrow : ag                  (bool)          [create,query]
          Specify true if you want the grid layout size to grow as children are added.  For example, if the grid layout has 2
          columns and 2 rows then adding a fifth child will cause the grid to expand to 3 rows if this flag is true, otherwise the
          grid will remain the same size and the new child will be hidden from view until you expand the size of the grid using
          the appropriate flags.  The default is true.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
          Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
    
      - numberOfColumns : nc           (int)           [create,query,edit]
          A positive non-zero integer value indicating the number of columns in the grid layout.

          A positive non-zero integer value indicating the number of rows in the grid layout.
    
      - numberOfRowsColumns : nrc      (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Two positive non-zero integer values for the number of rows and columns, respectively, in the grid layout.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - position : pos                 (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
          Specify the name of a child control in the grid layout along with a 1-based integer value indicating the desired
          position of the child.  Positions increase from left to right within a row and then wrap around to the next row
          increasing from top to bottom.  For example, a grid layout with 3 columns and 2 rows has 6 visible positions where 1, 2
          and 3 occupy the first row and 4, 5 and 6 occupy the second.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,

          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to

      - dropRectCallback : drc         (script)        [edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of
          the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y) The return value is an
          array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn,
          followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.

      - hyperlink : hl                 (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the label text to be a hyperlink if the argument is true.  The label text must be a proper HTML link. In MEL,
          double quotes in the link will most likely have to be protected from the MEL interpreter by preceding them with a
          backslash.  Clicking on the link will open it in an external Web browser.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
          will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - wordWrap : ww                  (bool)          [create,query]
          If true then label text is wrapped where necessary at word-breaks. If false, it is not wrapped at all. The default value
          of this flag is false.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers

          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify

def autoLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a form layout control. A form layout allows absolute and relative positioning of the controls that
    are its immediate children. Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that
    children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the
    argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six
    ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3
    leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an
    edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge
    of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side
    of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a
    fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a
    percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will
    determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is
    no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in
    each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate
    child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of
    divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a
    measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in
    pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:Avoid making control
    attachments that form a loop in control dependencies. For example: window; string $form = `formLayout`; string $btn1 =
    `button`; string $btn2 = `button`; string $btn3 = `button`;formLayout -edit-attachControl $btn2 top2 $btn1-attachControl
    $btn3 top2 $btn2-attachControl $btn1 right2 $btn3 $form;showWindow; $btn2 is attached to $btn1, $btn3 is attached to
    $btn2, and $btn1 is attached to $btn3. Thus, the placement of $btn1 is dependent on the placement of $btn3, which is
    dependent on the placement of $btn2, which is dependent on the placement of $btn1. The last control attachment will have
    created a loop in the dependencies. To prevent runtime errors, Maya will ignore this attachment and instead issue a
    warning that a cyclical control attachment has been detected in the script.

          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,

def headsUpDisplay(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) object which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport.
    It is to be used to provide hands-on information designated by a user script. The text string displayed on the viewport
    is formatted using the various flags of this command. The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block
    flags. Note if the preset OR command/trigger flags are not present, only a label will be drawn on the viewport. Upon
    creation of a HUD object, an ID number will be assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD object (-rid/removeID
    [int IDNumber]), if desired. Alternatively, HUD objects may be removed via their position (section and block), or their
    unique name.
    
    Flags:
      - allDescendants : ad            (bool)          [create,edit]
          This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached
          to a compound or multi attribute, then the HUD command will run due to changes to the specified attribute as well as
          changes to its descendants.
    
      - allowOverlap : ao              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag
          description for more details).
    
      - attachToRefresh : atr          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Attaches the command to the refresh process. The script is then run each time an idle refresh is run and updates
          directly following it.
    
      - attributeChange : ac           (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Runs the command when the named attribute changes value. The string must identify both the dependency node and the
          particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).
    
      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. The resultant output string of each HUD is
          formatted within each block, using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding,
          labelWidth and dataWidth). The layout is shown in the following diagram: __________________________________________ |
          |     |        |         |     |     | |  P  |  J  |   LW   |   DWX   |  J  |  P  |
          |_____|_____|________|_________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the entire block LW =
          Sub-block of width, labelWidth DWX = X number of sub-blocks of width, dataWidth, for X data elements. Block LayoutThe
          above diagram shows the layout of each block. The widths: padding, labelWidth and dataWidth are defined by their
          respective flags. To elaborate on the layout of the blocks, First the padding of the block is calculated. Then the two
          main sub-blocks (LW and DWX) in the above diagram, are justified and positioned together between the left and right
          margins of the block. The widths of the main sub-blocks are not variable based on it's contents. The only sub-block in
          the above diagram which is unique is the DWX sub-block which actually represents X number of sub-blocks, where X is the
          number of data elements returned by the command. Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge of
          the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility
          from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can
          be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error.
          Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.

      - connectionChange : con         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Runs the command when the named attribute changes its connectivity. The string must identify both the dependency node
          and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).
    
      - dataAlignment : da             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the alignment of the data blocks and the data text, within a HUD block. Available alignments are: leftand
          right. The default alignment is left.
    
      - dataFontSize : dfs             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          of the textbox.(To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
    
      - decimalPrecision : dp          (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are
          1 to 8.
    
      - disregardIndex : di            (bool)          [create,edit]
          This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached
          to a multi (indexed) attribute, then the HUD command will run no matter which attribute in the multi changes.
    
      - event : ev                     (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Runs the command when the named event occurs. The named event, must be a pre-defined Maya event. To get a list of what
          events exist, use the -le/listEvents flag.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag returns whether the given object exists in the Heads-Up Display layout. An object name must be supplied with
          this command. This flag cannot be combined with any other flag.
    
      - getOption : op                 (unicode)       [query]
          This flag will return the value of the option specified by the string. See setOption for a list of options
    
      - gridColor : gco                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies a color for the grid lines using the inactive color palette. Specifying an index number between 1 to
          23 will select the corresponding color in the palette.

          Specifies the pixel width of the virtual textboxwhich will hold the label. The contents of this textboxwill be left
          justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the textbox,the label will be truncated to fit within
          the dimensions of the textbox.(To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
    
      - lastOccupiedBlock : lob        (int)           [create]
          Returns the block number of the last occupied block in a given section.
    
      - layoutVisibility : lv          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the visibility of Heads-Up Display layout on and off. This does not modify individual visibilities of heads-up
          displays, but turns off the layout so that no heads-up displays will draw to screen. Personalized settings for the
          visibilities of HUDs are kept safe. This flag can only be used by itself, excepting edit and query.
    
      - listConditions : lc            (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available conditions.
    
      - listEvents : le                (bool)          [create,query]

          This flag will return a string array containing all names of existing HUDs.
    
      - listNodeChanges : lnc          (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available node changes.
    
      - listPresets : lp               (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available preset HUDs.
    
      - name : n                       (unicode)       [edit]
          This flag only permits the EDITING of the name of the Heads-Up Display.
    
      - nextFreeBlock : nfb            (int)           [create]
          Returns the block number of the next free block in a given section.
    
      - nodeChanges : nc               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Works only with selection based triggers (ie. SelectionChangedor SomethingSelected), otherwise this flag is ignored.
          This flag attaches the HUD script to execute on specific node changes of any selected node. This flag is used to set a
          nodeChange. In order to reset a nodeChange, use the -rnc/resetNodeChanges flag. To view a list of all available node
          changes, use the -lnc/listNodeChanges flag. The following is a list of available node changes and their function:
          attributeChange:  The script will be sensitive to any attribute changes in the currently                   selected
          nodes. connectionChange: The script will be sensitive to any connection changes in the currently
          selected nodes. instanceChange:   The script will be sensitive to any changes to an instance in the
          currently selected nodes. On query mode, this flag will return the values of all nodeChanges in pairs of values (the
          name of the nodeChange followed by its value). WARNING: (Performance Warning)          Attaching a nodeChange trigger to
          a selection based trigger can cause a large          performance drop, if the node change that is being watched is
          caused by the          HUD script itself. With this said, an attempt should be made to keep the HUD command/script
          simple and limited to retrieving data. Changing an attribute, creating or                  modifying a connection or
          instance will all result in a performance drop.
    
      - padding : p                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
    
      - preset : pre                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This setting is used to select certain pre-defined HUDs, some of which retrieve specific data, that is unobtainable
          through normal MEL commands or scripts. This flag is mutually exclusive from the command and trigger flag combination.
          However, presets can work with all other headsUpDisplay attribute flags (ie. block alignment, label, dataFontSize,
          etc.), unless otherwise specified below. To obtain a list of available presets, use the -lp/listPresets flag on this
          command. The following is a list of available presets and a description of each: cameraNamesThis will return the camera
          name that the view is looking through, in the data block, for each view that the HUD is drawing to.polyVertsThis will
          return three values in the data block, regarding the number of vertices that are visible by the camera. 1st Value:
          Represents the number of camera visible vertices, both active and inactive.2nd Value: Represents the number of camera
          visible vertices, on active objects only.3rd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, that are
          active.polyEdgesThis will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of edges that are visible by the
          camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.polyFacesThis will return three values in
          the data block, regarding the number of faces that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
          similar to the polyVerts preset.polyUVsThis will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of UVs that
          are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.polyTrianglesThis will
          return three values in the data block, regarding the number of triangles that are visible by the camera. The order of
          these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.materialLoadingCountThis will return the material loading count.
          It updates on each refresh.textureLoadingCountThis will return the texture loading count. It updates on each
          refresh.frameRateThis will return a single string carrying both the frame rate and the fpsstring in the data block. It
          updates on each refresh.viewAxisThis will draw the orientation of the grid axes within the HUD. It updates on each
          refresh. While this preset can take in all attribute flags, the only one which will have an effect are block attribute
          related flags (ie. block alignment and block size). The block dimensions of this preset are: blockSize - largeand
          blockWidth - 50, which results in a 50x50 pixel region.distanceFromCameraThis will return in the data block the distance
          from the view's camera to the centre of the bounding box containing the selected objects in the view.
    
      - refresh : r                    (bool)          [create]
          This flag forces the given Heads-Up Display element to refresh, updating the value displayed.  This flag cannot be
          combined with any other flag.
    
      - remove : rem                   (bool)          [create,edit]
          This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD name. This flag will override all other flags and is
          mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
    
      - removeID : rid                 (int)           [create,edit]
          This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD ID number assigned to it at creation time. This flag
          will override all other flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
    
      - removePosition : rp            (int, int)      [create,edit]
          This command will remove the contents of a specific block location in the HUD layout. This flag will override all other
          flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags. Syntax for this flag is: -removePosition/rp [section]
          [block].
    
      - resetNodeChanges : rnc         (unicode)       [edit]
          This flag will reset a specificied nodeChange back to false. This flag only operates under the edit flag. See the
          description for the -nc/nodeChanges flag for further details.
    
      - scriptResult : sr              (bool)          [query]
          This flag is only used in conjunction with the query flag. Calling a query on this flag returns the most recent result
          of the HUD.
    
      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.
          ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |
          |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each

          Adds a callback that is called when a new item is selected. The MEL script will have the newly selected item's value
          substituted for #1. For Python, the callback should be a callable object which accepts one argument, which is the newly

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          It sets the offset for the six columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the
          -columnAttach6 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly six columns.
    
      - columnWidth : cw               (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Arguments are : column number, column width. Sets the width of the specified column where the first parameter specifies
          the column (1 based index) and the second parameter specifies the width.
    
      - columnWidth1 : cw1             (int)           [create,edit]
          Sets the width of the first column. Ignored if there is not exactly one column.

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfItems : ni             (bool)          [query]

def symbolCheckBox(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a symbol check box.  A symbol check box is a simple control containing a pixmap and a state of
    either on or off. Commands can be attached to any or all of the following events:  when the symbol check box is turned
    on, turned off, or simply when it's state is changed.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside
          the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disableOffImage : dfi          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed when the check box is off and disabled.
    
      - disableOnImage : dni           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed when the check box is on and disabled.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - image : i                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

      - innerMargin : im               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag will revert the symbolCheckBox to its pre Maya 2.5 behaviour of having a 2 pixel inner margin. This flag is
          for backward compatibility on Linux only, and will be removed in future releases.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - offCommand : ofc               (script)        [create,edit]

          Command executed when the symbol check box is turned on.
    
      - onImage : oni                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed when the check box is on.

      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
    
      - marquee : mq                   (float, float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The arguments define the four corners of a rectangle: top left bottom right. The rectangle defines a marquee for the
          render computation.

          returns the number of images
    
      - nextViewImage : nvi            (bool)          [create,edit]
          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The nextViewImage flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism to store to
          the next view location.
    
      - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
          will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
          deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
    
      - pcaption : pca                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Get or set the permanent caption which appears under the image that is currently showing in the render editor.

      - removeImage : ri               (bool)          [edit]
          remove the current Editor Image from the Editor Image Stack
    
      - resetRegion : rr               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Forces a reset of any marquee/region.
    
      - resetViewImage : rvi           (bool)          [create,edit]
          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The resetViewImage flag tells the editor that it should reset its internal image storage mechanism to the first
          image. This would happen at the very start of a render view render.
    
      - saveImage : si                 (bool)          [edit]
          save the current Editor Image to memory. Saved Editor Images are stored in an Editor Image Stack. The most recently
          saved image is stored in position 0, the second most recently saved image in position 1, and so on... To set the current
          Editor Image to a previously saved image use the di/displayImageflag.
    
      - scaleBlue : sb                 (float)         [create,query,edit]

          Define the scaling factor for the red component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000
    
      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
          user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
    
      - showRegion : srg               (int, int)      [create,query,edit]
          Shows the current region at the given resolution. The two parameters define the width and height.

          width, third is the height.
    
      - snapshotMode : snm             (bool)          []
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
      - stereo : s                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Puts the editor into stereo image mode.  The effective resolution of the output image is twice the size of the
          horizontal size. The orientation of the images can be set using the stereoOrientation flag.
    
      - stereoImageOrientation : sio   (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the orientation of stereo camera renders.  The first argument specifies the orientation value for the
          firstleft image and the second argument specifies the orientation value for the right image. The orientation values are
          'normal', the image appears as seen throught he camera, or 'mirrored', the image is mirrored horizontally.
    
      - stereoMode : sm                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies how the image is displayed in the view.  By default the stereo is rendered with a side by side image.  The
          rendered image is a single image that is twice the size of a normal image, 'both'. Users can also choose to display as
          'redcyan', 'redcyanlum', 'leftonly', 'rightonly', or 'stereo'.  both - displays both the left and right redcyan -
          displays the images as a red/cyan pair. redcyanlum - displays the luminance of the images as a red/cyan pair. leftonly -
          displays the left side only rightonly - displays the right side only stereo - mode that supports Crystal Eyes(tm) or
          Zscreen (tm) renders
    
      - toggle : tgl                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Turns the ground plane display on/off.
    
      - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
          updates.
    
      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - viewImageCount : vic           (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The viewImageCount flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism for a given
          number of views.
    
      - viewTransformName : vtn        (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Sets/gets the view transform to be applied if color management is enabled in the current view.
    
      - writeImage : wi                (unicode)       [edit]

def iconTextCheckBox(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best
    fits the current size of the control given its current style. This command creates an iconTextCheckBox.
    
    Flags:
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The label alignment.  Alignment values are left, right, and center. By default, the label is aligned center. Currently
          only available when -st/style is set to iconAndTextCentered.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the
          callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
          a Windows only flag.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.

          This flag is used to specify the Maya LT version that this control feature was introduced, if the version flag is not
          specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and
          otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only
          accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as 2014).

      - rotation : rot                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          The rotation value of the image in radians.
    
      - selectionHighlightImage : shi  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed while the control is selected and the cursor is over the control. Image size must be the same as the
          image specified with the -i/imageflag. This is a Windows only flag.
    
      - selectionImage : si            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed while the control is selected. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the -i/imageflag.
          This is a Windows only flag.
    
      - style : st                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are iconOnly, textOnly, iconAndTextHorizontal, iconAndTextVertical, and
          iconAndTextCentered. (Note: iconAndTextCenteredis only available on Windows). If the iconOnlystyle is set, the icon will
          be scaled to the size of the control.
    
      - useAlpha : ua                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Is the image using alpha channel?
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - value : v                      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets or returns the state of the control.
    
      - version : ver                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specify the version that this control feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version
          number (e.g. 2013, 2014). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as
          2014).
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

def channelBox(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a channel box, which is sensitive to the active list.  It displays certain attributes (channels) of
    the last node on the active list, and provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date. Note: when setting
    the color of attribute names, that color is only valid for its current Maya session; each subsequent session will
    display the default color for the attribute name(s) listed in the Channel Box. Any subsequent attributes that are added
    to the Channel Box will be affected by prior regular expressions in their current Maya session.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - attrBgColor : bc               (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          Controls the background text color of specific attribute names. As with the foreground option, this text coloring also
          depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color
          components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of
          \*for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed
          will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.
    
      - attrColor : ac                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          Controls the foreground text color of specific attribute names. This text coloring also depends on the node name choice
          for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in
          value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*for a regular expression. The same
          idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be
          affected in the channel box.
    
      - attrFilter : af                (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on the channel box. This filters the attributes displayed. A
          filter of 0can be used to reset the filter.
    
      - attrRegex : ar                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which attribute names should be selected for foreground text coloring.
          If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously
          applies to the flag nodeRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be
          treated as though it were case-insensitve
    
      - attributeEditorMode : aem      (bool)          [query,edit]
          Modifies what appears in the channel box for use in the attribute editor. Default is false. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - containerAtTop : cat           (bool)          [query,edit]
          This flag can be used to specify whether or not the container is drawn at the top of the channel box when a node in the
          container is selected.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - enableLabelSelection : els     (bool)          [query,edit]
          Enables the selection of attributes in the channelBox when used in conjunction with -attributeEditorMode. Default is
          false.  Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - execute : exe                  (unicode, bool) [edit]
          Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in
          the channel box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell
          value.)  Before the command is executed, #Ais substituted with the name of the attribute, and #Nwith the name of the
          node, and #Pwith the full path name of the node.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
    
      - fieldWidth : fw                (int)           [query,edit]
          An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to fields appearing in the channelBox.
    
      - fixedAttrList : fal            (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [create,query,edit]
          Forces the channel box to only display attributes with the specified names, in the order they are specified.  If an
          empty list is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of listing all keyable attributes.
    
      - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
          Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents

      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - historyObjectList : hol        (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of every INPUT node associated with an object on the main object list that is of
          the same type as the node displayed in the INPUT section of the channel box.
    
      - hyperbolic : hyp               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Determines whether or not the distance that the mouse has been dragged should be interpreted as a linear or hyperbolic
          function.  The default is set to hyperbolic being false.
    
      - inputs : inputs                (bool)          [query]
          Returns the items shown under the 'INPUTS' heading in the channel box.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - labelWidth : lw                (int)           [query,edit]
          An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to labels appearing in the channelBox.
    
      - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the
          -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The channel box
          will only display the (last) item contained in the selectionConnection object. If a NULL string () is specified, then
          the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of working on the active list.
    
      - mainObjectList : mol           (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of every object on the active list that is the same type as the object displayed in
          the top (main) section of the channel box.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - maxHeight : mh                 (int)           [query,edit]
          An optional flag which is used to limit the height of the channelBox.
    
      - maxWidth : mw                  (int)           [query,edit]
          An optional flag which is used to limit the width of the channelBox.
    
      - niceNames : nn                 (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
          longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
          longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - nodeRegex : nr                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which node names should (potentially) have their attributes selected for
          foreground text coloring. If nodeRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*' for a regular expression. The
          same idea simultaneously applies to the flag attrRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this
          regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve Note: nodes in namespaces have regular expressions
          applied as though those nodes weren't in namespaces
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - outputObjectList : ool         (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of every OUTPUT node associated an object on the main object list that is of the
          same type as the node displayed in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
    
      - outputs : out                  (bool)          [query]
          Returns the items shown under the 'OUTPUTS' heading in the channel box.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]

          Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels.
          Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - select : s                     (bool)          [edit]
          Allows programmatic selection of items (nodes or plugs) in the channel box. Selection is equivalent to clicking the item
          with the mouse; therefore only items currently shown in the channel box can be selected this way.
    
      - selectedHistoryAttributes : sha (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the INPUT section of the channel box.
    
      - selectedMainAttributes : sma   (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the top section of the channel box.
    
      - selectedOutputAttributes : soa (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
    
      - selectedShapeAttributes : ssa  (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
    
      - shapeObjectList : sol          (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of every shape associated with an object on the main object list that is of the
          same type as the object displayed in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
    
      - shapes : shp                   (bool)          [query]
          Returns the items shown under the 'SHAPES' heading in the channel box.
    
      - showNamespace : sn             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Controls whether or not the namespace of an object is displayed if the object is not in the root namespace.
    
      - showTransforms : st            (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether this control will display transform attributes only, or all other attributes. False by default.
          Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - speed : spd                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Controls the speed at which the attributes are changed based on the distance the mouse has been dragged.  Common
          settings for slow/medium/fast are 0.1/1.0/10.0 respectively.  The default is 1.0.
    
      - takeFocus : tf                 (bool)          [edit]
          causes the channel box to take over the keyboard focus, if it can.
    
      - update : u                     (bool)          [edit]
          This flag can be used to force an update of the channel box display, for example after changing a display preference.
    
      - useManips : mnp                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          When you click on a field or label in the channel box, the tool switches to a manipulator that can change that value if
          you drag in the 3d view.  This flag controls the kind of manips.  Allowed values are none(self-explanatory),
          invisible(you won't see anything, but dragging in the window will adjust any of the selected attributes), and
          standard(the same as invisible, except for scale, rotate, and translate, which will be represented by their usual
          manips.)
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

    A dictionary of keywords shared by all controls can be created and passed to this function and settings which don't pertain
    to the element being created will will be ignore.  For example, 'precision' will be ignored by all non-float UI and
    'sliderSteps' will be ignore by all non-slider UIs.
    
    :Parameters:
        dataType : string or class type
            The dataType that the UI should control.  It can be a type object or the string name of the type.
            For example for a boolean, you can specify 'bool' or pass in the bool class. Also, if the UI is meant to
            control an array, you can pass the type name as a stirng with a integer suffix representing the array length. ex. 'bool3'
    
        numberOfControls : int
            A parameter for specifying the number of controls per control group.  For example, for a checkBoxGrp, numberOfControls
            will map to the 'numberOfCheckBoxes' keyword.
    
        slider : bool
            Specify whether or not sliders should be used for int and float controls. Ignored for other
            types, as well as for int and float arrays
    
        value : int, int list, bool, bool list, float, float list, string, unicode, Path, Vector,
            The value for the control. If the value is for an array type, it should be a list or tuple of the appropriate

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - back : bk                      (bool)          []
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - command : c                    (unicode)       []
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All

          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    from an existing hotkey set. In create mode, users can choose to specify which hotkey set to duplicate by using the
    -source flag. A duplicated hotkey set is independent from the source hotkey set.
    
    Flags:
      - current : cu                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the hotkey set as the current active hotkey set. In query mode, returns the name of the current hotkey set.
    
      - delete : delete                (bool)          [edit]
          Deletes the hotkey set if it exists. Other flags are ignored. Returns true|false depending on the delete operation.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists. Other flags are ignored.
    
      - export : ep                    (unicode)       [edit]
          Exports a hotkey set. The argument is used to specify a full path of the output file.
    
      - hotkeySetArray : hsa           (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of all existing hotkey set names.
    
      - ip : ip                        (unicode)       [edit]
          Imports a hotkey set. The argument is used to specify a full path of the hotkey set file to import.
    
      - rename : re                    (unicode)       [edit]
          Renames an existing hotkey set. All white spaces will be replaced with '_' during operation.
    
      - source : src                   (unicode)       [create]
          Specifies the source hotkey set. If flag is not provided, the current active hotkey set is used.                  Flag
          can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    This command is used for saving the contents of a menu, so that another instance of the menu may be recreated later. The

def connectControl(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command attaches a UI widget, specified as the first argument, to one or more dependency node attributes. The
    attributes/nodes don't have to exist yet, they will get looked up as needed. With no flag specified, this command works
    on these kinds of controls: floatField, floatScrollBar, floatSlider, intField, intScrollBar, intSlider, floatFieldGrp,
    intFieldGrp, checkBox, radioCollection, and optionMenu. With the indexflag, It will also work on the individual
    components of all other groups. This command sets up a two-way connectionbetween the control and the (first-specified)
    attribute. If this first attribute is changed in any way, the control will be appropriately updated to match its value.
    Summary: if you change the control, ALL the connected attributes change. If you change the FIRST attribute attached to
    the control, then the control will change. NOTE: the two-way connection will not be established if the attributes do not
    exist when the connectControlcommand is run. If the user later uses the control, the connection will be established at
    that time. To effectively use connectControlwith radioCollections and optionMenus, you must attach a piece of data to
    each radioButton and menuItem. This piece of data (an integer) can be attached using the dataflag in the radioButtonand
    menuItemcommands. When the button/item is selected, the attribute will be set to the value of its data. When the
    attribute is changed, the collection (or optionMenu) will switch to the item that matches the new attribute value. If no
    item matches, it will be left unchanged. There are some specialized controls that have connection capability (and more)
    built right into them. See attrFieldSliderGrp, attrFieldGrp, and attrColorSliderGrp. Using these classes can be easier
    than using connectControl.
    
    Flags:
      - fileName : fi                  (bool)          [create]
          This flag causes the connection to be treated as a filename, and the conversion from internal to external filename
          representation is made as the data is copied. This only applies to connections to Tfield controls.
    
      - index : index                  (int)           [create]
          This flag enables you to pick out a sub-control from a group that contains a number of different controls. For example,
          you can connect one field of a floatFieldGrp.  You must count each member of the group, including any text labels that
          may exist.  For example, if you have a check box group with a label, the label will count as index 1, and the first
          check box as index 2.  (Indices are 1-based)
    
      - preventContextualMenu : pcm    (bool)          [create]
          If true, this flag will block the right mouse button menu of the associated control attribute.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
          that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
          -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
    
      - getCurrentSetOfItem : gcs      (int)           [query]
          Returns the current set of item at the given row. As an item can belong to number of sets, current set is the set to

          This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are active. Note: if the outliner is
          driving the contents of another editor, setting highlightActive to true may produce unexpected behavior.
    
      - highlightConnection : hlc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all

      - highlightSecondary : hs        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are contained in the highlightConnection.
    
      - ignoreDagHierarchy : hir       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies whether or not DAG objects are displayed in their DAG hierarchy. Warning: using this flag without
          some other form of sensible filtering will lead to a very confusing outliner.
    
      - ignoreHiddenAttribute : iha    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'hidden in outliner' flag on nodes.
    
      - ignoreOutlinerColor : ioc      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'use outliner color' flag on nodes.
    
      - isChildSelected : ics          (PyNode)        [query]
          This flag allows you to query if one or more of the children of the specified item is selected in the outliner. The item
          should be specified using a unique DAG path. Note that if the specified item appears multiple times in the outliner, the
          result will be true if one or more children of any occurrence of the specified item in the outliner is/are selected.
    
      - isSet : isSet                  (int)           [query]
          Returns true if the item present at the given row is a set.

      - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
          Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
          Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
    
      - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the
          -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
    
      - mapMotionTrails : mmt          (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Specifies exactly which attributes are displayed when showAttributes and expandConnections are both true. If true, the
          dependency graph is searched upstream for all curves that drive the selected plugs (showing multiple curves for example
          in a typical driven key setup, where first the driven key curve is encountered, followed by the actual animation curve
          that drives the source object). If false, only the first curves encountered will be shown. Note that, even if false,
          multiple curves can be shown if e.g. a blendWeighted node is being used to combine multiple curves.
    
      - sortOrder : so                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the scroll bar's value marker.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - numberOfFields : nf            (int)           [create]
          sets the number of fields.  Only allowed values are 2 to 4.  If not specified, defaults to 3.  NOTE: if the -at flag is
          used when this widget is created, the number of children in the attribute will determine the number of fields.  Also
          note:  after creation, the number of fields cannot be changed with the -e flag.

    This command creates a check box.  A check box is a simple control containing a text label and a state of either on or
    off.  Commands can be attached to any or all of the following events:  when the check box is turned on, turned off, or
    simply when it's state is changed.
    
    Flags:
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This flag is obsolete and should no longer be used. The check box label will always be left-aligned.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside
          the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The

      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify

      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the check box.  By default, this flag is set to true and the check box value may be changed by
          clicking on it.  If false then the check box is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check box can
          always be changed with the -v/valueflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.

      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
          will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
          If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the

def attrNavigationControlGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged label navigation button. The group is used to
    help the user manage connections to a particular attribute. When creating the control you have the opportunity to attach
    scripts to the control that are executed on various UI events.  You can define what happens when the navigation button
    is pressed, and when a node is dragged and dropped onto this attribute. The navigation button can traverse to the
    connected node or can bring up UI to create new connections to the attribute. The button also can show you state
    information: if there already exists a connection/if the connection is ignored.

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - alwaysInvokeEnterCommandOnReturn : aie (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets whether to always invoke the enter command when the return key is pressed by the user. By default, this option is
          false.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the text changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -tx/text flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disableButtons : db            (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the visibility state of search field buttons to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode returns
          whether both buttons are visible or not.
    
      - disableClearButton : dcb       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the visibility state of search field clear button to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode
          returns whether clear button of search field is visible or not.
    
      - disableHistoryButton : dhb     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the visibility state of search field history button to true/false depending on the passed value. In Query mode
          returns whether history button of search field is visible or not.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - drawInactiveFrame : dif        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets whether the text field draws itself with a frame when it's inactive. By default, this option is false.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
          If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the
          -tx/text flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - insertionPosition : ip         (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the
          field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

def hyperGraph(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The following is an overview of the basic features of the hypergraph. A more detailed description is given in the user
    manuals. The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya scene graph.  The hypergraph
    supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene hierarchy and the dependency graph. The default view of the hypergraph
    editor is the DAG view. The user can show the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes
    and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options.  The user can save any view by setting a bookmark
    to that view.  The user can also show previous views using the view options provided. The hypergraph supports a simple
    editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG  view, the
    user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the dependency graph view, the user can select
    connections and delete them or make new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections. The
    hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and freeform.  In automatic mode, the graph nodes are
    automatically positioned according to the layout preferences.  In freeform mode, the user can position nodes manually.
    The node position is saved in the scene. A background image can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be
    used as a template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout. Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed.
    The state is saved in the scene.  The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are collapsed. In
    addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression, constraint and deformation relationships in the
    DAG. These can be enabled/disabled through the options provided.  There are also additional filters for showing shape
    nodes and invisible nodes.  The amount of detail show may affect the speed of the display of the graph. Most of the UI
    features of the hypergraph are addressable through the hypergraph command-line interface.  The available command-line
    options are described in the next section.

    This command creates a control for editing a 2D control curve. This control attaches to a curve attribute, which must be
    a multi attribute where each entry is a compound composed of: A single float for control point positionA single float
    for control point valueThe MEL command AEaddCurveControl should be used to attach this control to an attribute in the
    attribute editor templates.
    
    Flags:
      - addControlVertex : acv         (unicode)       [edit]
          Used to add a control vertex for the curve.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - asString : asString            (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Used to query and set the value of the curve as a string of comma separated values
    
      - attribute : at                 (PyNode)        [create]
          Specifies the name of the curve attribute to control.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [edit]
          Specifies a command to be executed whenever the value of this curve is modified.
    
      - currentKey : ck                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Returns the index of the currently selected key.
    
      - currentKeyValue : ckv          (float, float)  [query,edit]
          Get or set the value of the currently selected key.
    
      - customCurveWidget : ccw        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Determines whether or not the curve widget is using a custom curve. When a custom curve is used, it is stored by a
          falloff curve in the brush tool settings, and the flag should be true.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - deleteControlVertex : dcv      (int)           [edit]
          Used to delete a control vertex of the curve.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.

          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - readOnly : ro                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Specifies if the curve is read only or not. If true, the curve can't be edited.

def tabLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a tab group. Tab groups are a specialized form of control layouts that contain only control
    layouts. Whenever a control layout is added to a tab group it will have a tab provided for it that allows selection of
    that group from amongst other tabbed control groups. Only one child of a tab layout is visible at a time.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - borderStyle : bs               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specify the style of the border for tab layout. Valid values are: none, top, notopand full. By default, it will use
          fullto draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout. none- Do not draw borders around the body area of the
          tab layouttop- Only draw a simple line right below the tabsnotop- Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top)
          of the tab layoutfull- Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-
          selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - childResizable : cr            (bool)          [create,query]
          Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a
          minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidthflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when a tab is double clicked on.  Note that the first click will select the tab and the second click
          will execute the double click command.  Double clicking the current tab will re-invoke the double click command.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - minChildWidth : mcw            (int)           [create,query]
          Specify a positive non-zero integer value indicating the minimum width the tab layout's children.  This flag only has
          meaning when the -cr/childResizableflag is set to true.
    
      - moveTab : mt                   (int, int)      [create,edit]

          Command executed when the 'New Tab' button (on the tab bar) is clicked.  Note: in order to show the new tab button use
          the -snt/showNewTabflag.  Using this command will override any internal Maya logic for adding a new tab (only this
          command will be executed).
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
          Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.

          invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTabor
          -sti/selectTabIndexflags.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
          user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
    
      - setOperationLabel : sol        (int, unicode)  [edit]
          uses the string as the new name for the existing operation type specified by the integer index. Note that there is no
          messaging system which allows UI to be informed of changes made by this flag.
    
      - showObjects : so               (bool)          [create]
          Restricts the display to columns that are in the current active list.

          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
          updates.
    
      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.

    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - asString : asString            (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Used to query and set the value of the ramp as a string of comma separated values
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [edit]
          Specifies a command to be executed whenever the value of this ramp is modified. This option should not be used when
          specifying an optionVar.
    
      - currentKey : ck                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Returns the index of the currently selected key.
    
      - currentKeyChanged : ckc        (script)        [edit]
          Specifies a command to be executed whenever the selected key changes.
    
      - currentKeyColorValue : clv     (float, float, float) [query,edit]
          Get or set the color of the currently selected key. Only useful if the ramp is set to be a color ramp.
    
      - currentKeyCurveValue : cvv     (bool)          [query,edit]
          Get or set the value of the currently selected key. Only useful if the ramp is set to be a curve ramp.
    
      - currentKeyInterpValue : civ    (int)           [query,edit]
          Get or set the interpolation value for the current key.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [edit]
          Specifies a command to be executed while the ramp is being modified.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - rampAsColor : rac              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets whether the ramp should be viewed as a colour ramp or as a curve.  Default is as a curve.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

          Used during query to specify the point at which to query the curve.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

def shelfButton(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best
    fits the current size of the control given its current style. This command creates an iconTextButtonthat is designed to
    be on the shelf. The button contains a command that can be drag'n'dropped.
    
    Flags:
      - actionIsSubstitute : ais       (bool)          []
    
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          only available when -st/style is set to iconAndTextCentered.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - command : c                    (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control is pressed.
    
      - commandRepeatable : rpt        (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Set if the MEL command specified in the command flag should be repeatable or not.  The gkey, by default, is the shortcut
          to repeat the last executed command.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
          a Windows only flag.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control is double clicked.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - enableCommandRepeat : ecr      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag only affects menu items to which a command can be attached.  Specify true and the command may be repeated by
          executing the command repeatLast.  This flag is true by default for all items except for option box items.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

def iconTextRadioButton(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best
    fits the current size of the control given its current style. This command creates a iconTextRadioButton that is added
    to the most recently created iconTextRadioCollection unless the -cl/cluster flag is used.
    
    Flags:
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The label alignment.  Alignment values are left, right, and center. By default, the label is aligned center. Currently
          only available when -st/style is set to iconAndTextCentered.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the
          callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create]
          To explicitly add the control to the specified collection.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
          a Windows only flag.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - rgbValue : rgb                 (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]

      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and
    float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports the notion of a larger secondary range of
    possible field values. If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max values defined in
    the attribute.  The user-specified values can reduce the min and max, but cannot expand them. The field created here is
    an expression field -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the
    character =.  This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the slider. The field also has an
    automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button. The contents of this menu change depending on the state of the

      - columnWidth : cw               (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Arguments are : column number, column width. Sets the width of the specified column where the first parameter specifies
          the column (1 based index) and the second parameter specifies the width.
    
      - columnWidth1 : cw1             (int)           [create,edit]
          Sets the width of the first column. Ignored if there is not exactly one column.
    
      - columnWidth2 : cw2             (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Sets the column widths of both columns. Ignored if there are not exactly two columns.
    
      - columnWidth3 : cw3             (int, int, int) [create,edit]

      - columnWidth4 : cw4             (int, int, int, int) [create,edit]
          Sets the column widths for all 4 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 4 columns.
    
      - columnWidth5 : cw5             (int, int, int, int, int) [create,edit]
          Sets the column widths for all 5 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 5 columns.
    
      - columnWidth6 : cw6             (int, int, int, int, int, int) [create,edit]
          Sets the column widths for all 6 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 6 columns.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Sets the minimum value for both the slider and the field. (by default max and min are set according to what is in the
          attribute, if anything.  If no max and min are specified, or if only one of the two are specified, then no slider is
          created.)
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

    Create a scroll bar control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  The scroll bar
    displays a marker indicating the current value of the scroll bar relative to it's minimum and maximum values.  Click and
    drag the marker or on the scroll bar itself to change the current value.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the scroll bar's value marker.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into
          that cell. The procedure does not need to return any value. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1)
          is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form: global proc procedureName(int $row, int $column, string

          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - cellBackgroundColorCommand : cbc (script)        [create,edit]
          Sets the script to call when it requires the background color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer
          arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints
          which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper

      - cellChangedCmd : ccc           (script)        [create,edit]
          Sets the script to call when somebody has changed the value of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments
          specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into
          that cell. The procedure should return an integer value which indicates whether that value should be accepted (return 1

          the cleared cells
    
      - columnFilter : cf              (int, unicode)  [create,edit]
          Filter the specified column with the string value provided. Set filter to columns 0 will apply the filter to all
          columns. The filter is case insensitive and support wildcards. Wildcard Matching: Wildcard matching is much simpler than
          full regexps and has only four features: c    Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below. Thus c
          matches the character c. ?     Matches any single character. It is the same as . in full regexps. \*   Matches zero or
          more of any characters. It is the same as .\* in full regexps. [...]    Sets of characters can be represented in square
          brackets, similar to full regexps. Within the character class, backslash has no special meaning. (i.e. you can search
          for MyValuewith y\*uor ??Val??or [MyThe]Valueor any letters in MyValueThe column number is 1-based (i.e. the first row
          is 1 not 0).

          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - deleteRow : dr                 (int)           [edit]
          Delete the specified row The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the table. By default, this flag is set to true, and the table can be edited. If false, then the table
          is 'read only' and cannot be typed into.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Sets the script to call when it requires the contents of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments
          specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return a string which is the value
          for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (ie. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should
          be of the form: global proc string procedureName(int $row, int $column)

def scrollLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a scroll layout.  A scroll layout is useful for when you have a number of controls which cannot all
    be visible at a time.  This layout will display a horizontal and/or vertical scroll bar when necessary to bring into
    view the hidden controls. Since the scroll layout provides no real positioning of children you should use another
    control layout as the immediate child.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - borderVisible : bv             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Visibility of the border.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - childResizable : cr            (bool)          [create,query]
          Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a
          minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minimumChildWidthflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - horizontalScrollBarThickness : hst (int)           [create,edit]
          Thickness of the horizontal scroll bar.  Specify an integer value of pixels greater than or equal to 0. Other than
          setting the value to 0 to hide the scrollbar, this flag has no effect on Windows systems.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfChildren : nch         (bool)          [query]
          Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.

      - panEnabled : pe                (bool)          [query,edit]
          Set to true if you want to pan the scroll layout using ALT + MMB. On OSX, in one button and two button mode, you could
          use command+alt+LMB to pan it. The pan effect is disabled by default.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]

    Create a slider control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  The slider displays
    a marker indicating the current value of the slider relative to it's minimum and maximum values.  Click and drag the
    marker or on the slider itself to change the current value.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to

          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - highlightColor : hlc           (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
    
      - horizontal : hr                (bool)          [create,query]
          Orientation of the slider.  This flag is true by default which corresponds to a horizontally oriented slider.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          Lower limit of the slider.
    
      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]

          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - step : s                       (float)         [create,query,edit]
          The step value represents the amount the value will increase or decrease when you click either side of the slider.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - value : v                      (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Value of the slider.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    Create a slider control that accepts only integer values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  The slider
    displays a marker indicating the current value of the slider relative to it's minimum and maximum values.  Click and
    drag the marker or on the slider itself to change the current value.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - textureMaxSize : tms           (int)           [query,edit]
          Set maximum texture size for hardware texturing.  The integer value must be a power of 2.  Recommended values are 128 or
          256.  If the value specified is larger than the OpenGL maximim textures size for the graphics hardware it will be
          clamped to the OpenGL size.  If many large textures are used in a scene reducing this value improves performance.  On
          Impact texture memory is pinned in RAM so using large textures can cause reliability and performance problems. Again
          reducing this value will help. Software rendering does not use this value. This flag is obsolete as of Maya 6.5. The
          maxTextureResolution/mtr argument on the displayPref command should be used instead.

          Returns the name (if any) of the objectSet which contains the list of objects visible in the view if viewSelected is
          true and the list of objects being displayed does notcome from the active list.
    
      - viewSelected : vs              (bool)          [query,edit]

def dockControl(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Create a dockable control, also known as tool palette or utility window. Dock controls are secondary windows placed in
    the dock area around the central control in a main window. Dock windows can be moved inside their current area, moved
    into new areas and floated (e.g. undocked). Dock control consists of a title bar and the content area. The titlebar
    displays the dock control window title, a float button and a close button. Depending on the state of the dock control,
    the float and close buttons may be either disabled or not shown at all.
    
    Flags:
      - allowedArea : aa               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Areas where the dock control may be placed. Valid values are top, left, bottom, rightand all.  The default is all.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - area : a                       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The initial dock area for this dock control. This is a required flag.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - closeCommand : cc              (script)        [create,edit]
          Script executed after the dock control is closed.
    
      - content : con                  (unicode)       [create,query]
          The name of the control that is the content of this dock control.  This is a required flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dockStation : ds               (unicode)       [create]
          The name of the control the window can be docked into. If this is not set it is assumed to be the main window.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The

          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of
          the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y) The return value is an
          array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn,
          followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.

          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.                  Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
    
    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.outlinerPanel`
    """

    pass


def floatSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
    text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field range
    values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to
    enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.  To
    do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
    command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
    result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
    floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to
    select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.
    If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the
    slider as well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits
    will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to
    the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          Set this widget up for sound scrubbing. Subsequent changes to current time will result in sound scrubbingbehavior, until

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

def intSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
    text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field
    range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you
    to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.
    To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
    command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
    result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
    intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select
    any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.  If you
    enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as
    well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits will
    never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the
    field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160. TelfBaseGrpCmd.cpp

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          The command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

def textFieldButtonGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command adds a button to the textFieldGrp command.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the
          -tx/textflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
    
      - insertionPosition : ip         (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the
          field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

    The colorEditorcommand displays a modal dialog that may be used to specify colors in RGB or HSV. The default behaviour
    when no arguments are specified is to provide an initial color of black (rgb 0.0 0.0 0.0). The command will return the
    user's color component values along with a boolean to indicate whether the dialog was dismissed by pressing the
    OKbutton.  As an alternative to responding to the colorEditorcommand's return string you can now query the
    -rgb/rgbValue, -hsv/hsvValue, and -r/resultflags to get the same information. The final argument is 1 if the dialog's
    OKbutton was pressed, and 0 if the Cancelbutton was pressed.In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    This command defines the callbacks for a type of scripted panel.  The panel type created by this command is then used
    when creating a scripted panel.  See also the 'scriptedPanel' command.
    
    Flags:
      - addCallback : acb              (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies the callback procedure for adding the panel to a particular control layout.  The parent layout is
          guaranteed to be the current default layout when the proc is called.  If its name is required then it can be queried
          with 'setParent -q'.  Any editors should be parented here. global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
    
      - copyStateCallback : ocb        (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies the callback procedure for copying the state of the panel when a tear-off copy of the panel is made.
          The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName, string $newPanelName) { .... } This procedure
          will be executed immediately after the addCallback procedure has finished executing. At that point, the copied panel
          will be fully created and accessible to facilitate copying of panel settings. Note: the addCallback procedure is called
          after the createCallback procedure has been called.
    
      - createCallback : ccb           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

def floatField(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Create a field control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  An invisible slider
    is attached to the field and accessed by holding down the Ctrl modifier key while pressing one of the mouse buttons.
    Dragging the invisible slider to the right with the middle mouse button increases the field value by the amount
    specified with the -s/stepflag, while dragging to the left decreases the value by the same amount.  The left and right
    mouse buttons apply a factor of 0.1 and 10 to the step value.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when the field changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/valueflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (script)        [create,edit]
          Command executed when dragging in the field.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
          If false then the field can not be changed interactively.  However, you can change the field text with the -v/valueflag
          regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

def paneLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a pane layout.  A pane layout may have any number of children but at any one time only certain
    children may be visible, as determined by the current layout configuration.  For example a horizontally split pane shows
    only two children, one on top of the other and a visible separator between the two.  The separator may be moved to vary
    the size of each pane.  Various other pane configurations are available and all display a moveable separator that define
    the size of each pane in the layout.
    
    Flags:
      - activeFrameThickness : aft     (int)           [create,query,edit]

      - activePaneIndex : api          (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The active pane index.  The active pane has a colored border surrounding it.  Only one pane may be active at any one
          time.  Using either of the flags -ap/activePaneor -api/activePaneIndexwill automatically deactivate the previously
          active pane.  The argument is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered
          clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.  If any other index is specified then the
          current active pane is deactivated.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (script)        [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (script)        [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

      - noBackground : nbg             (bool)          [create,edit]
          Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the
          background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          procedure should take one string argument which is the panel's name.
    
      - replacePanel : rp              (unicode)       [edit]
          Will replace the specified panel with this panel.  If the target panel is within the same layout it will perform a swap.

    Flags:
      - allAttr : aa                   (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of all the attribute names currently being displayed.  This flag is ignored when not being queried.
    
      - attrRegExp : are               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Filter the current displayed attribute names. This expression matches the case-insensitive substring of attribute names.
    
      - control : ctl                  (bool)          [query]
          Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.
          Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return NONEif no control is present.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

      - execute : exe                  (unicode)       [edit]
          Immediately executes the command string once for every selected cell in the spreadSheet.  Before the command is
          executed, #Ais substituted with the name of the cell's attribute, #Nis substituted with the name of the cell's node, and
          #Pis substituted with the full path name of the node.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
    
      - filter : f                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the
          main list of the editor.
    
      - fixedAttrList : fal            (<type 'unicode'>, ...) [create,query,edit]
          Forces the editor to only display attributes with the specified names.
    
      - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
          that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
          -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
    
      - highlightConnection : hlc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all
          editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
    
      - keyableOnly : ko               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Limits the displayed attributes to be those that are keyable. True by default
    
      - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
          Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
          Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
    
      - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Controls whether the attributes are displayed using their long names or their short names.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
    
      - niceNames : nn                 (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
          longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
          longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it
          will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is
          deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
    
      - precision : pre                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the maximum number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal place.  Can be 0 to 20.
    
      - selectedAttr : sla             (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of all the attribute names that are selected.  This flag is ignored when not being queried.
    
      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the
          user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
    
      - showShapes : ss                (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, when transforms are selected their shapes will be displayed instead.
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
      - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
          updates.
    
      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.                  Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
